# Hackathon_Hacker_Data

# Project Description

We get the data from Facebook using Facebook Graph API. The dataset are from about Hackathon Hackers (HH), which has become the biggest Facebook group for hackathon attendees. Currently, it has over 18k members. It's a place to discuss hackathons, tech news, college, high school, and dank memes. It had 53 different public subgroups. 

Facebook limits developers to any public graph data at Facebook due to the privary. This dataset in csv file is 245.5 MB. The time range is from 7/1/2014 - 8/20/2015, which is more than one year. This is the larget dataset I could get from Facebook Graph API. It has more than 1,300,000 items. It includes information about members' likes, comments and posts. 



## Subgroup
Subgroup must satisfy one of these prerequisites:
- 1 week old, 5 posts, and 250 members

## Comment count

(Hackathon Hackers,640,link,"Tracy Chou, an engineer at Pinterest, shared this story with me: A couple years ago she attended a technical conference and on the first day, she wore a dress. When she walked around the conference, no one came up to talk to her. When she asked people very technical questions about their stack, questions she assumed would indicate that she was a programmer, she was brushed aside and told, “You wouldn’t understand.” She went back home that night really frustrated and flustered. She almost didn’t feel like going to the conference the next day. But she did and wore a nerdy tshirt and jeans instead, and she had a better experience that day. People assumed she was technical and didn’t dilute their explanations to her."

As a woman who mostly wears t-shirts, jeans, and hoodies, this tendency for people to think "wearing a dress--must be non-tech" doesn't impact my professional life all that much. But I do remember having more "femme-presenting" (put in quotes because I don't believe their is anything inherently sexed about clothing--it's all social construction...but that's off point) friends back at Google last summer who would ALWAYS be mistaken for someone from Human Resources. Which was ridiculous to me because, HR was such a minority, it made no sense to assume any random person wasn't an engineer.

(Hackathon Hackers,399,status,I really wish "coding for girls" wasn't a thing. Its accepted because its part of our industry culture. But look how weird this sounds:

"Coding for boys"
"Coding for LGBT"
"Coding for Asians"
"Coding for Caucasians "

... Weird right?  

Everyone should just be everyone, gender doesn't effect how good of a developer you are. The fact in this industry that we fight negative gender discrimination with positive gender discrimination is a disservice to the intelligent, decent human beings who populate the development scene. 

Its a shame we cant see passed boobs :/. 

Just my two cents ^.^. Wanted to open up a discussion on the fact. I could be completely wrong!

---------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: Girls coding together, ANY group coding together is, obviously, always really cool. Im more talking about different genders banding together because they feel discriminated on by the overall scene.

 FINAL UPDATE:

Having posted this around 9.30am I logged out at 10.30 and logged back in half hour ago @ 7.30.

Completely shocked and disappointed to see the storm I created in HH. I started this thread with the best of intentions to initiate an open discussion with no malice. 

As I opened this thread I think I should probably start by apologising for creating such a toxic environment in HH today. Trust me when I say seriously lesson learned.

Im not going to delete the thread. I think it holds a valuable lesson that topics like this should be kept well clear of HH.

Etiene Dalcol  Im sorry for offending you directly. I cannot talk on behalf of the thread but after reading through I wanted to at-least apologise to you directly.

Love each other, respect each other  
Peace <3)

I'm looking to run some user interviews to validate some ideas we have. I'll gladly hook you up with a domain+swag for your help. Any takers?)
(Hackathon Hackers,193,status,When in doubt, post in Hackathon Hackers.

It's come to my attention that many people are afraid to post in HH. How can we change this and make people feel more comfortable posting?)
(Hackathon Hackers,193,photo,Hello guys, this happened at HtN. They expelled someone for a "bomb threat" Everyone, EVERYONE at HtN and especially the MLH mods there KNOW the event that both the OP and the commenter were referring to. However instead of realizing the comment was specifically referring to the fact that Ahmed's clock was mistaken for a bomb. They mistook the comment for a bomb threat.  Hackathons are supposed to be inclusive and fun, not used to exclude people because you didn't like what they said.

EDIT: Here is MLH's response: 

"Hackathons are a fun environment and there’s a time and place for jokes during one. Who hasn’t made a joke about being sleep deprived or stinky after one? That said, jokes about bombs or hurting people in general are not ok. Ever.

This weekend at Hack the North, we had an incident where two students made a joke in poor taste about building a bomb. Their comments were inspired by recent events with Ahmed Mohamed and his clock.

We were alerted to the presence of the post by other participants who saw it and felt unsafe. We acted in accordance of the Major League Hacking incident response procedure and our official code of conduct. We worked with the event organizers to locate the individuals and alerted the relevant authorities and school administration.

In this case, it was clearly a joke in poor taste and they didn’t actually build a bomb. However, because of the nature of the incident, we expelled them from the event immediately and covered their expenses to get home.  Both participants were aware of the severity of the situation and departed from the event on good terms.

As hackers, we deeply sympathize with Ahmed and are supportive of his creative exploration. In fact, we’re working with another Major League Hacking event to get him to his first hackathon. We hope he attends! That said, this is not an example of creativity being misunderstood. This is an example of a bad joke that went too far. If anything, this incident set Ahmed’s cause back by being insensitive to real issue at hand.

If you have questions, please find Swift at Hack the North or email us at incidents@mlh.io. We’re happy to discuss it.

Happy Hacking,

— Swift"

(Hackathon Hackers,185,link,Hello Hackathon Hackers! I just finished writing my article about why I dropped out of high school. Might be worth a read if you're considering dropping out (or if you already have as a "I've experienced that too!" moment) or if you're just interested in knowing my reasons. Cheers! )

# Current Progress
The batch layer is ready. ```csv``` dataset are uploaded ```/mnt/scratch/yiqin/input``` in the cluster. facebookGraphNode.thrift is created to process the data. ```uber-yiqin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar``` is also in the cluster. ```create_Facebook_Graph_Data_Table.pig``` is to create the table and show the table. You can see the data are stored.

Facebook graph data are so difficult to deal with, but contain interesting information. I'm going to finish the project in the next 4 days.
